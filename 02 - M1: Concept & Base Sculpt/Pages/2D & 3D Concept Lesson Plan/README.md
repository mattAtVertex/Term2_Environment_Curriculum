<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this week you’re going to begin your journey on the capstone project. To do this we will use a course that is laid out at vertexschool.com. This is a separate login from canvas. &nbsp;I apologize for the slight inconvenience. It is, as you’ll see, a massive course and proved quite difficult to move.</p>
<p>The goal of week one is for you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop your 2D concept</li>
<li>Create a basic 3D concept sculpt</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Develop Your 2D Concept</h4>
<p>When developing the concept, we provide you with two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design your own brief</li>
<li>Choosing a concept</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re gonna design your own brief, don’t worry about taking it too far. You’ll be able to build out parts as you progress. However, you have to know that this is one of the limitations of this approach… You will have to build out and discover a lot of things as you go. This path is only recommended for those who feel they have more than average capacity here.</p>
<p>Choosing a concept someone else has made us a perfectly viable path and is what you will actually do in your day job, anyways. However, the limitation is that it’s somebody else’s work. You’ll want to ask for permission. You don’t have to wait for that permission to be granted but you do want to ask. They may turn you down. You may not find as much motivation &nbsp;as if you were building your own. One of the biggest advantages here, though, is that you’re standing on the shoulders of someone else and, hopefully, getting farther in your work because of that.</p>

<h4>Create a basic 3D concept sculpt</h4>
<p>In the second part of this weeks work, you sculpt a basic Maquette of your model in ZBrush. This is a direction that most character artist go to ensure that they have a general sense of how their concept will work in 3-D. This is generally considered to be the Concept Sculpt and is one of the keys to ZBrush's early success.</p>

<p>I remember in my early days at Pixologic, we were asked to consult with ILM, who had artists working out of James Cameron‘s house building concepts for avatar. James Cameron brought in 2D illustrators in traditional and digital medium, clay sculptors and digital sculptors. At the end of the day, digital sculptors were able to offer so much value to the concept art department that they became a de facto part of the concept art workflow at ILM and other places.</p>
<p>The key with the concept sculpt is to not take anything too seriously. Try to suggest the forms and put energy into your work. The manufacturing process, i.e. using marvelous designer and building the low poly, will generally suck the energy out of your piece. So, it is better to add as much as you can in the beginning so that it lasts.</p>

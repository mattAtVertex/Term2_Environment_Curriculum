# Face Sculpting Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p><span>This week the goal is to sculpt the face of your character from a base mesh.&nbsp; Don't sweat if you are unhappy with the results.&nbsp; This takes time.&nbsp; Just do your best to make the model your own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As always, remember that mentors rule. They may ask you to do more or less or they may cut things down to be more achievable for you.</span></p>

# Sculpt Costume Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p><span>This week the goal is to finish your Hi Poly costume by sculpting it and transferring it into ZBrush. This may involve recasting the geometry using ZRemesh end it may involve creating new parts of your model entirely and Maya or ZBrush.</span></p>
<p><span>As always, remember that the mentors rule. If they ask you to go in another direction that you agree with Vertex is 100% behind you and the mentor. Our goal is simple, lock down the hi poly costume of our character so we can progress to finishing the head and creating the low poly.</span></p>
<h2><span>Note about content</span></h2>
<p><span>This phase can be time consuming. Depending on how many parts you must bring into ZBrush… It can take some time. We’ve included quite a bit of content. For those using the Marvelous Designer approach, you should see week three and week four available in our supporting lectures.</span></p>
<p><span>Both week three and week four are focused on, for the most part, finishing off the clothing developed in marvelous designer. The lectures are there to support you and, hopefully, give you some inspiration as you peruse them. Remember, though, you are in the arena here. It’s less about learning and mostly about execution so make sure to rely on your mentors and to direct message your lead if you have any concerns.</span></p>

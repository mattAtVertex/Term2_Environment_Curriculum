# Low Poly & UVs I Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p>In this mile stone, the goal is to be done with our high poly sculpt and to start getting everything ready for texturing.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that this stage has one main purpose for us… what is that purpose? That purpose is to get us in a position to texture paint our character.</p>
<p>Why do I tell you this? Because, this stage is not important in and of itself. You have a lot of flexibility in the type of topology you create… Within boundaries. However, few people are going to be looking at your topology and judging you on it unless it’s obviously wrong. That said, the opposite is true for texturing. Everybody’s going to be looking at your texturing job and judging that.</p>
<p>So, the purpose of this mile stone is partly to get through this mile stone as quickly as you possibly can. We do have constraints, though. You do have to be mindful of the different types of topology and the various skill signals that you want to broadcast.</p>
<h3>What Is A Skill Signal?</h3>
<p>In case we haven’t talked about this before or you have forgotten… A skill signal is simply an aspect of your work that communicates your skill. For example, when you were texture painting the prop we spent time focusing on gradients. Gradients send a signal to people that are watching or looking at your work that you are not just some self-taught game artist… But that you have some sense of the craft.</p>
<p>Skill signals broadcast nuances of your skill to those who are listening. So what are the skill signals that we want to broadcast with low poly and UV‘s?</p>
<h3>Types of topology</h3>
<p>Before we get into the skill signals lets make sure we have some terminology.&nbsp; Above I said that you have a lot of flexibility. However, there are certain lines that you just shouldn’t cross. In order to understand the better let’s make sure that you understand the different types of topology:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Decimated topology</li>
    <li>Kit bashed topology</li>
    <li>Animation ready topology</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decimated topology</strong> is used for hard surface objects and objects that do not deform. That means that they do not squash or stretch or bend. Props can be decimated. Scans are all decimated. The geometry is typified by random triangles. This can be done through ZBrush's decimation master.</p>
<p><strong>Kit bashed topology</strong> is when you jam one sphere into a cube into another sphere and your model ultimately has cylinders and squares jammed into and interpenetrating each other. This is incredibly important in the early stages when you’re developing the idea more than the model. It’s more of a concept stage.</p>
<p><strong>Animation ready geometry</strong> is generally typified by quad faces. That is faces with four edges to them. These are generally arranged in rows and easy to view groups. A character’s face always has to be animation ready. Their hands and most of their body also needs to be animation ready.</p>
<p>There are, though, instances where there is a mix of methods. For example, a T-shirt that has a lot of folds in it won’t necessarily be perfectly quaded out. It’ll have triangles and the geometry might move diagonally to be able to capture a fold at a lower polygon resolution then would be necessary if everything was arrayed out with quads.</p>
<h3>Skill Signals For Characters Topology</h3>
<p>So, let’s get back to the question of what are the skill signals that we want to send in the characters topology. I’ll list them out below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Polygon to pixel ratio</li>
    <li>Animation ready topology with the game focus</li>
    <li>Separate parts generally have separate geometry</li>
    <li>Full characters generally have 6 to 10 Textra sets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polygon to pixel ratio </strong>is as important here as it is with the prop. You don’t want the geometry on the shoulder of your character to be denser than the geometry on the thigh of your character. Do you want them to be roughly the same. Their job is to cover the same number of pixels on a screen as most other parts of the body or clothing. The exception is the face and the hands. Humans pay more attention to these areas so they need to be more detailed to capture the more subtle movement that’s required.</p>
<p><strong>Animation ready geometry</strong> with a game focus means that you’ve placed triangles in the character. In film, there used to be a lot of focus on avoiding triangles at all costs. That is not the case for games. Triangles are in efficiency. When used properly they cut down on the number of polygons that are required. The example we gave earlier of a shirt still works here. By putting a few triangles at the beginning in the end of a fold in a shirt you’re able to capture how the fold blends back in without adding a bunch of quads the average it out.</p>
<p><strong>Separate parts get separate geometry</strong>. Years ago, we would combine the mesh into one fairly watertight mesh. Meaning that a jacket would share geometry with the clothing and body if there was one underneath it. However, as games advance … The rigging becomes more sophisticated. A jacket is it on. A shirt is its own. The belt is its own. Separate parts get separate geometry shells.</p>
<p><strong>Full characters generally get a lot of texture sets</strong>. You’re not creating background characters. I don’t want your portfolio to have a bunch of background characters. I wanted to have a bunch of glorious cinematic looking characters. Remember, there is a difference between getting the job and doing the job. You may do background characters. However, the way to get that job is to show them a whole bunch of pretty pictures that inspire them to hire you. So, spend that texture space. Create as many texture sets as you need to make the cinematic and beautiful.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In summary, this phase mean importance is to enable you to texture paint. So don’t get precious.&nbsp; Do, though, pay attention to the face. Make sure that you were using the appropriate method i.e. decimation, kit bashing, animation ready… in the appropriate place. Send the right signals... :)</p>

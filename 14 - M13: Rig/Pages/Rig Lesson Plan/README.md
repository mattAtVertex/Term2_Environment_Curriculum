# Rig Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p>In this mile stone, we focus on rigging our character. This is an entirely optional milestones. You do not have to do this. However, it will 100% help you in your job search.</p>
<p>Rigging, like grooming, showcases that you have a technical aptitude that certain teams may be looking for. You’re not just a pretty face. You can actually get inside the belly of the beast and get your hands dirty with some of the more technical stuff.</p>
<p>It also has the potential to eventually increase your salary as riggers earn a significant amount more than sculptor‘s.</p>
<p>Do you have to be technical? Do you have to know how to code? No. You do not have to know how to code and rigging has become significantly easier than it was back in my day… When I had to walk to school barefoot in the snow uphill both ways.</p>
<p>It is very procedural, though. It is one of those things that requires you to be clear on the step-by-step. There are also options for automatic riggers and there’s online rigging solutions from Adobe that work wonders.</p>
<p>This week is built around creating a rig specifically so you can take advantage of all the amazing animations in Unreal Engine. It also includes instructions on how to set all of that up and animate your character inside of the game engine.</p>
<p>Very exciting!</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Rigging helps your portfolio stand out and is becoming easier day by day. If you have time try it but this is entirely optional.</p>

# Texture I Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p>In this mile stone your goal is to material block your entire model. That means that every surface should have some two essential material elements on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat color associated with the model</li>
<li>General roughness associated with the material</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can go further, then each of your materials should have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color variations using the ramp technique</li>
<li>Roughness variation</li>
<li>Bottom gradient</li>
<li>Top gradient</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re feeling especially generous, you might also add a curvature layer to each material.</p>
<p>The key element here is that every part of the model has a material associated with it and that they are all developed roughly to the same level. Next week, you can fine-tune and focus. However, this week I would really like for you to get the entire surface of the model covered with color and roughness value.</p>
<h3>Common mistakes</h3>
<p>At this point in your work it is important to be practicing proper time management. To help you and listing out a few common mistakes below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing too early</li>
<li>Not using the texture machine system</li>
<li>Waiting until topology is better</li>
<li>Waiting until UV‘s are better</li>
<li>Using default smart materials</li>
</ul>
<p>If you<strong> focus too early</strong> you run the risk of robbing yourself of time later on. Let the software to do some of the heavy lifting for you. You’ll be surprised at how little you actually have to do for materials once you get the system down.</p>
<p><strong>The texture machine</strong> is one of the ways that you make the software work for you. The students who treat this from a more procedural perspective are generally the ones who create more robust results. Of course, we want a lot of layers and a lot of variation… However, it can often become difficult to manage. So, by starting out with the texture machine and establishing all of the basic layers that we taught you it will help you stay more organized. This will, in turn, allow you to make iterations and changes days later when you forgotten what some layer does.</p>
<p>Are you waiting until your topology is better before you start texturing? Well, stop it. Use ZRemesh. Use Decimation Master. Get topology done as quickly as you can. This is the gap. If you do not create low polygon topology… You’re not a game artist, yet. However, if you create low polygon topology… Even if it has problems… Well, you've become a game artist! You might need to improve your topology… But as soon as you create a low poly and get that textured you become a game artist and not just a digital sculptor.</p>
<p>If you’re waiting until your UV‘s are perfect, then I need you to check with your mentor to see if they are at least serviceable. Maybe they are not production ready… But will they enable you to get a texture on your model that is not distorted? Please, check in with your mentor and make sure that you achieve a balance between getting it done and being perfect.</p>
<p>Using default smart materials can be useful, I’m not going to lie to you. However, these are the same smart materials that everybody else has. Even buying smart materials and using those can sometimes be problematic. In a game production, they may not want to deal with the hassle of licensing materials… So they will want you to create your own. This doesn’t mean that you have to avoid them entirely. I’ve seen students grab alphas or normal maps from smart materials and then just create their own color and roughness.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In summary, the goal of this milestone is to material block in your entire model. Do your best with using a basic texture machine. However, do not get too focused on one part. We will do that next week.</p>

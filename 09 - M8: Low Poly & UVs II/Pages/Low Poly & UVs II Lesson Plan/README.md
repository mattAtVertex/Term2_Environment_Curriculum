# Low Poly & UVs II Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p>in this milestone, you’ll continue developing the topology for all your parts and you’ll engage time management practices with the focus of delivering topology and UVs on time.</p>
<p>Again, the most important thing is that you are working towards delivery on time. Many of the problems that you are experiencing now or problems that were set in motion weeks ago when you chose your concept and as you begin the high polygon sculpting. This is a perfectly fine time to start to transition what your focus is or what the scope of the work is. What if your behind schedule, though?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you more, below are a few of the scenarios that can happen and how you should address them.</p>
<p><strong>Haven’t even started low resolution topology…</strong></p>
<p>If you have not even started low polygon topology then you need to pivot on your model by selecting a focal area such as the face and shoulders and remove all other parts of the model from consideration.</p>
<p><strong>I’m only halfway through the low resolution topology and haven’t even got to the UV‘s…</strong></p>
<p>In this case, start using more automated solutions to build your low polygon topology. For example, you can use ZRemesher or even Decimation Master in ZBrush to quite quickly create topology that’ll work on a functional level if not on an optimized level.</p>
<p><strong>Struggling with how to create UV‘s for all the different parts…</strong></p>
<p>If you’re struggling with how to create the UV‘s, please reach out to us and your mentor. If UV‘s are always difficult for you, then consider creating automatic UV‘s through UV Master inside of the ZBrush or, even, picking up Houdini and using some of its tools for automatic UV‘s. They’re used in production every day.</p>
<h3>Skill Signals and UV‘s</h3>
<p>In the last few weeks we spoke about skill signals. These are clues that recruiters an artist use to be able to judge your work capacity overall. Remember, they can’t know the depth of you from one interview but that’s not their concern. Their concern is whether or not you can do the job you’re hired for in a reasonable amount of time… And to make that judgment they rely on signals inside of your work that broadcast where you are as an artist.</p>
<p>Every person who hires artists has, at one point, saw amazing artwork… brought the artist in for an interview… hired them on the spot… and then discovered that they only know how to do the sexy stuff that makes it look beautiful… but not the stuff that makes their work fit into a game engine. That is definitely a sucky position for the hiring company to be in. Most often, the sexy stuff is for the leads and the artists that have been there for years ahead of you.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like cleaning up only when you have company and putting everything into the closet. Nobody’s really going to know that. They’re just gonna say, what a clean person. I wish my house was as clean and organized as that person‘s… next thing you know, they move in with you and discover you're a closet mess!&nbsp; Oh no!!!! :)</p>
<p>Well, the easy way for a hiring company to find out more about you and your skill level is to simply look in your closet. In this case, look at your UV‘s. These are a great way for others to see how much craft you have in your work.</p>
<p>So, what are the signals that broadcast you have skills here… There are not too many so I’ll listen below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arranged on axis</li>
<li>Consistent polygon face-UV ratio</li>
<li>Thoughtfully laid out you UVs</li>
<li>Mostly human readable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arranged on axis</strong> means that your UV shells are mostly straight up and down vertically or left and right. A UV shell is not placed at a diagonal relative to its world space. You should, in application, be able to apply a wood grain that goes top to bottom and have it register on your model perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent polygon face– UV ratio</strong> means that the size of your polygon face is in the UV‘s are consistent. The easy test is to apply a checker to your model. Most programs have this feature built-in. In the brush, you can just turn the texture on for a model and choose one of the checker like patterns.<br>If the checkers are different sizes across the models then you have a problem that must be addressed. The only exception is for areas of your model that might have UV‘s but are never seen. Those you can shrink down in place somewhere in the bottom right corner or where they won’t disturb the other UV shells.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughtfully laid out UV‘s </strong>means that your models UV shells are clumped in rational ways that help your texture map be readable by humans, not just machines. For example, if you have an oaken barrel then you want all of the planks to be a raid close to each other while the top in the bottom might be located above but next to each other as well. Even though they are not physically close to each other they both serve the same purpose and so should be grouped.</p>
<p><strong>Human readable</strong> is still relevant, though, I don’t know for how long. At some point UV‘s will be automated and something we humans don’t deal with. I think Disney is even doing that now today. However, I believe, they use 3-D painting processes and projections to enable that. With the way we do things in game art, we should be able to see what looks like a wooden plank pattern in a texture then translated into our texture model and still readable by us. You can see an example of that <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/DYzwR" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Make sure that you are finishing low poly and UV‘s. If not, check the possible scenarios above and the suggested course of action. UV‘s are a way for hiring managers to assess your craft and can be important triggers that tell a team whether you can do some of the grunt work as well or you’re only there for the sexy.</p>

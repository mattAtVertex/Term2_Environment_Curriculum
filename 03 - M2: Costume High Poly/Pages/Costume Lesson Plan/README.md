<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this week the goal is to start work on the production version of your characters costume. Note, we are doing this different than term two. We are not starting with the face but with the characters clothing.</p>
<p>You can use marvelous designer. You can use Maya for more hard surface activities. You can even use zbrush for more hard surface techniques as long as you are using the appropriate workflows and creating something that has clean edges and will become production ready.</p>
<p>As always, remember that the mentors rule. If they ask you to go in another direction that you agree with, Vertex is 100% behind you and the Mentor. If you need resources, let us know and we’ll see if we can find them.</p>
<p>The goal of week one is for you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start work on the Production version of your characters costume, AKA The High Poly. Either through marvelous designer or some other workflow.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>What Do You Mean Production Ready?</h3>
<p>What do you mean by Production ready? Why not just say High Poly? Well, There are a lot of steps involved in the production but the production -base begins with this High Poly version. Previously, you were in the concept phase. Very different... Note, you are by no means expected to produce a finished low rez version that will go into the game this week…</p>
<p>I want to stress, Production Ready will stretch over multiple weeks. What we want to do this week is start to transition from the sculpt to something that will become our finished product.</p>
<p>Let me give you a few examples:</p>
<p>You can sculpt armor in ZBrush for concept. You can use the brushes to create something that looks like it was sculpted in zbrush. . It will look like it was sculpt in ZBrush and not like metal. &nbsp;If you want to make it look like metal then you need to start looking at the polygon modeling toolset in Maya, Blender, etc.</p>
<p>You can sculpt clothing in ZBrush for concept. The Standard brush is great for creating folds. However it can leave lots of small undulations in the form that are hard to control and ultimately leave it looking like it was sculpted in ZBrush and it’s not cotton or denim or whatever material you need it to look like. &nbsp;If you’re going to create clothing, marvelous designer is the best tool to give you control over how a fold behaves and how the clothing is constructed.</p>
<h3>One Note About Marvelous Designer vs ZBrush</h3>
<p>What’s important about Marvelous Designer is that it is a very true to form production tool. ZBrush is not really a production tool. It was originally developed more for the concept artist. We always focused on concept artists. There were many attempts to add UI and tools that helped production artists that Ofer ultimately ignored. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ZBrush is supposed to be an art tool not a production tool. This leads to biggest strengths and its biggest weaknesses. It is only as good as the artist who is wielding it. This is a very important point because it’s different in marvelous designer.</p>
<p>When you’re developing a production pipeline, you generally want tools that allow you to plug in artists and unplug them. &nbsp;If you were dependent on any one artist then that can create complications and make scaling difficult. For example, if you depend on one artist to do faces and now you suddenly have 200 characters… You got a problem.</p>
<p>The same is true for clothing. If you have one artist sculpt amazing clothing in ZBrush but that’s literally one out of several thousand… Then your entire 100 million dollar production is now dependent on one person or one rare type of person. Obviously, that’s not acceptable from a business perspective.</p>
<p>Enter Marvelous Designer. Marvelous is much less dependent on the artist skill. It’s much more trainable because you just have to learn how to create the right patterns and work with the UI… sort of…</p>
<p>That said, marvelous designer has built some wonderful freeform tools and has worked hard to create artist friendly pipelines. &nbsp;It is the de facto standard for creating clothing for realistic characters. The only competition it has is scanning. It’s worth noting that Naughty Dog does not appear to use marvelous designer at all and relies entirely scans.</p>

# Texture II Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p>In this milestone we will focus on the skill signals that relate to texturing. If you’ve done this the way I suggested, then you now have a character that has basic materials assigned to each one of the parts with a basic set up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In practice this means that you have folders in Substance Painter with Material Id masks for each area of model. The gloves will have a glove material. The boots will have a boot material. The jacket will have a jacket material… This does not mean that they are on separate texture sets…</p>
<h3>Skill Signals For Texturing</h3>
<p>What are the skills signals for texturing? Well, they’re probably no more important skill signals for you to be aware of then those related to texturing. Texturing is the real battle ground for your portfolio. They will forgive anatomy mistakes in the face. They may forgive topology and UV mistakes, if they catch them. However, they will not forgive unfortunate texturing.</p>
<p>Here are the skills signals for texturing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color variation</li>
<li>Roughness variation</li>
<li>Gradients</li>
<li>Realistic edge effects and wear</li>
<li>Material distinction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Color variation</strong> is something you should be aware of at this point. It means, that the models albedo has slight hue shifts that allow it to simulate a real world object. A character‘s face is not entirely pink or brown… It will have small huge shifts as well as elements like veins.</p>
<p><strong>Roughness variation </strong>is one of the easiest things to fix and not doing it is one of the biggest mistakes students make. They leave it to the end and then they forget and then… They present a model that looks like it’s made from 1980s graphics. A super sharp specular highlight that looks like a RenderMan render of a teapot.</p>
<p>However, the other side to this is when a student creates a roughness variation with too much contrast. You have to find the sweet spot where it’s not obviously CG but The roughness is not drawing attention to itself either. There should be a subtle variation in the grays of your roughness map.</p>
<p><strong>Gradients</strong> take a little bit more time to set up but, again, they are essential. I’ve mentioned this throughout our time together. If you do not put gradients on your model… You should not even present the texture. They take 10 minutes to set up. however, not sending them up will 100% lead to somebody questioning your ability to do the job. They are important. I cannot overstayed their value. That said, it can be a little tricky to know how subtle to make them so make sure to check out and him lots of work here – insert name lot Dash to see the gradient that we consider acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic edge effects </strong>really comes down to just one thing: did you throw a curvature map on it and apply it equally to most areas of the model? You’ve got to make sure to go in and vary the edge affect just like it would in the real world. You don’t want to have an obvious curvature layer applied. It needs to be subtle and built-up, possibly, over many layers.</p>
<p><strong>Material distinction</strong> refers to something that we haven’t talked a ton about. Basically, it means that each area of the model should have a fairly distinctive material. Let me see if I can explain it another way. Imagine your character has leather on the shoulder, on the forearm, around the thigh, and mixed into the boot area. A beginning character artist might apply the same leather material to all of those areas. However, because they’re in different parts of the body they’ve all got a different story to tell. The leather mixed in and around the boots will be exposed to the elements differently than the leather around the thigh. So, even though they may be the same leather… Your job is to make each area distinct and its own.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In summary, your goal now is to refine the texture on the model for each of its parts and to tell the story of that material.</p>

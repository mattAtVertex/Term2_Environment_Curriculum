<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p><span>This week the goal is to actually finish your high poly costume by adding accessories and finally in your sculpt in zbrush or whatever application you're using.</span></p>
<p><span>As always, remember that mentors rule. They may ask you to do more or less or they may cut things down to be more achievable for you.</span></p>
<h2><span>Note about content</span></h2>
<p><span>As mentioned in the previous lesson plan, this stage can be time-consuming. It can consume all the time that you have. I have seen it eat up 80% of previous students available time. Don't let that happen. Make sure that you understand what "feature creep" is. Your job is to execute and achieve. So, if you have to reduce what you actually do... Now is the time.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are doing hard surface or Armor then keep focusing on the high poly sculpt.&nbsp; We will move into Low Poly next week.</span></p>

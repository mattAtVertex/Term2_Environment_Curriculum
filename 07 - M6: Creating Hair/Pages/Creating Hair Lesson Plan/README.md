# Creating Hair Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p><span>This week the goal is to develop the hair of your model.&nbsp; We have training available to do this via XGen and also via ZBrush. Please note, you are unlikely to get this 100% done in one week but you can get a start on it that you can keep developing.</span></p>
<p><span>As always, remember that mentors rule. They may ask you to do more or less or they may cut things down to be more achievable for you.</span></p>

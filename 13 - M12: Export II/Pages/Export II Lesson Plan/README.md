<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p>In this objective, youâ€™re just going to continue the work of last week and getting everything into the game engine. Remember, to work strategically. Make to do lists if that helps but every day make sure that you know what the biggest and most important thing is on your list. Do everything you can to knock that off your list today.</p>

# Export I Lesson Plan

<h2><span>Objective</span></h2>
<p>In this milestone, this week, the goal is to just get the models into the game engine with materials assigned to as many parts of it as possible and with each of those materials having at least an albedo map assigned. This will enable us to just do our color blocking.</p>
<p>There are two weeks to this phase and it can take longer. It can also be stressful. One of the most important things I can share with you at this stage is what I feel to be the most productive mindset: the Conductor mindset</p>
<h3>The Conductor Mindset</h3>
<p>There are a lot of details that need to be resolved at this stage. This is not a creative phase. You’re not coming up with something new. Instead, you’re managing.</p>
<p>In this phase, you are managing all of the parts and pieces of your model like a conductor manages his or her orchestra. The goal is to have all the instruments in the right place and playing the right tune. However, things rarely start that way.</p>
<p>Will a conductor be successful if they stop every 30 seconds to correct one or the other instruments? Will a conductor be successful if they pay too much attention to the details and forget that the overall goal is larger?</p>
<h3>The One Thing</h3>
<p>Time management techniques are useful and there’s a big industry pushing them… However, they can often become their own burden. Instead, I like to recommend students write down all the stuff that they need to do and then find one thing in that list that’s gonna have the biggest impact today.&nbsp; Every day you make a list and then pick the one priority that will have the biggest impact in your project.</p>
<p>If we use the conductor mindset above, we can imagine that a conductor could have 100 musicians that they manage. If they spend time on the harpsichord is that going to improve the overall performance more than anything else?</p>
<p>The problem we battle here is time. You have a lot to get done and you have a limited amount of time. You cannot achieve perfection. You can simply give it your best shot. However, your best shot can be better than all the other shots before if you learn how to strategically focus on one thing at a time.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Now it’s time to export everything and import it into the game engine. Don’t get caught up in small details like a UV problem on the bottom of your character shoe. Instead, each day pick the most important problem for you to solve and work your way from big problems to small.</p>
